## Overview


A ride sharing summary dataframe will be created for ride sharing data based on city type: urban, suburban, or rural. The total weekly fares for each city type will be analyzed using line graphs. The analysis will be used to make decisions based on how the data differs by city type.

Rural city types have the fewest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Urban city types have the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. 

The average fare per ride increases from urban to rural cities. The same can be said for the average fair per driver. 

The number of rides and drivers have an inverse relationship with the average fares.

In the first quarter of the year 2019, fares peak for all city types in late February. General trends for one city type are seen in the other city types.
