# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview


A ride sharing summary dataframe will be created for ride sharing data based on city type: urban, suburban, or rural. The total weekly fares for each city type will be analyzed using line graphs. The analysis will be used to make decisions based on how the data differs by city type.

## Results:

Rural city types have the fewest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Urban city types have the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. 

The average fare per ride increases from urban to rural cities. The same can be said for the average fair per driver. 

The number of rides and drivers have an inverse relationship with the average fares.

In the first quarter of the year 2019, fares peak for all city types in late February. General trends for one city type are seen in the other city types.

## Summary: 

Business recommendations for addressing disparities among city types:

1. Offer a promotion at the start of March, when total fares dips in all city types from the end of February.

2. Determine if there is a causative correlation between number of rides, city type, and/or average fare per ride. Are there less rides in rural cities because there are less people or because there are less drivers? Do drivers charge more in rural cities because trips are farther or because they get less total rides? Answering these questions will help determine how to increase total fare in rural cities.

3. The average fare per driver is less than the average fare per ride for drivers in urban cities. This is not the case for other city types. Increasing driver pay may increase total fare for urban cities.
